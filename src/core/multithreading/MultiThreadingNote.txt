#Mutli-Threading:
    - Multithreading enhances the capabilities of Multi-Tasking by breaking down individual tasks
      into smaller sub-tasks or threads. These threads can be processed simultaneously, making better
      use of CPU capabilities.

    - In Java Multithreading is the concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximise utilisation of
      CPU. This multithreading capabilities are the part of java.lang package, making it easy to implement
      concurrent execution.

     - In single-core environments, multi-threading in managed by JVM and OS, which switch between the threads to give
       an illusion of concurrency. Threads share a single core and time-slicing is used to manage thread execution.

     - In multi-core environment, JVM can distribute threads across multiple cores allowing true parallel execution of
       threads.

     - Thread is light-weight process, the smallest unit of processing. Java supports multi-threading through it's
       java.lang.Thread class & the java.lang.Runnable interface.

     - When a Java Program starts, one thread begins running immediately which is called the Main Thread. This thread is
       responsible for executing the main method of a program.
